## What are the Pros and cons of TDD
Test-driven deployment (TDD) is a software design method where features are thoroughly tested before deployment.
A common approach to TDD is to write tests for a feature before implementing that feature. The reason for this is
to think about the design from the perspective of an end user rather than to let implementation details introduce 
bias. Some advantages of this approach are that the code is very modular, and it will consist of multiple small 
commits that implement independent features. This makes the code a lot easier to maintain. Another significant add
advantage is the code is tested, which allows us to ensure that any deployed features are of a certain quality.
The main disadvantages of TDD are that it makes the development process a lot slower and that if requirements change
then a lot of tests must be refactored.
